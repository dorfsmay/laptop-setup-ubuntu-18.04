== Screen rotated at 90°
=== Immediate fix
On one laptop, the screen orientation was as expected after the initial installed, but rotated 90° after the customization. Running `xrandr -o normal`:

. open a terminal `[Ctrl]` + `[Alt]` + `[F2]`
. type: `xrandr -o normal`

=== Keep orientation
For one laptop, it looked like the right setting was displayed, but the wrong one was saved on file. This, fixed the issue:
. Open "Settings" -> "Devices" -> "Screen Display"
. Change "Orientation" to "Portrait Right" -> "Apply" -> "Keep Changes"
. Change "Orientation" to "Landscape" -> "Apply" -> "Keep Changes"
